# ComboCharts

**Note**: This is a very early work in progress, much of the work here will change and some of the functionality described is not yet functional. This project is very much a learning experience of me!

**Note**: ComboCharts does not currently work with D3 4.0, use a 3.X version. Support for 4.0 coming soon™

ComboCharts is a WIP graphing library based on D3.js aimed at bringing interactivity to charts. With the ability to mix charts and tool elements, select data, customize events and update charts with animated transitions, ComboCharts aims to provide all the functionality you would need to create interactive charts.

##### Motivation
This library started when I was having trouble finding an open source graphing library that provided the interactivity I wanted.
